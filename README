# Old implementation utilized perl, with hash table insetion and quicksort.
# Insertion: Theory: O(1), but approaches O(n) in practice due to the sheer number of entries being inserted by property of rehashing.
# Sorting: Theory: O(nlogn) but may approach O(n^2) in practice due to quicksort's random choice of pivots.

# I will be implementing in C, with a potential tree (AVL/ balanced) structure.
# Insertion: Theory: O(logn) guaranteed performance for insertion.
# Sorting: Theory: O(nlogn) (no change from previous)

# Usage: 
> make
> ./group_gt1 directory_in/input_name.txt directory_out/output_name.txt
